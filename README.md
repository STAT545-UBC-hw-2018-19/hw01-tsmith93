## 1. Description of repository
Well look at that, you've stumbled onto this repository! I am very *excited* that you decided to visit. I created this repository for homework 1 for STAT 545A, a gradute level statistics course taught at the University of British Columbia. In this repository, you will find this very `README.md`, which is a GitHub-Flavoured Markdown. You will also find a `.Rmd` and a `.md` file, showing off some of my *new* skills in data exploration. Finally, you will find `hw01_instructions.md`, which are instructions that helped me make this repository and content.

### 2.2 Education

I decided the best way to summarize my education is in a table:

Credential | Institute
-----------|------------
BSc (Combined Honours) | Dalhousie University
Post-Degreee Diploma | Vancouver Island University 
MSc | University of British Columbia

### 2.3. What I study

I am lucky to say I get to study **salmon** :fish: Specifically, I am looking at the relationship between the **productivity** of juvenile salmon, and how that relates to extreme stream **discharge** events. I am hoping that my research will provide further insight into minimum flow requirmements for streams, to maximize **conservation** efforts, whilst still support human needs. 

### 2.4 Things I like

I like many things. But my top 5 things are:
- [x] Spending time outside

A thought ot leave you with, through the words of Bil Keane:

>Tomorrow's the future,
>Today is a gift, that's why it's called the present
